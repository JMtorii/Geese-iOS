Swap
=====

Swap is an app that lets users swap things.  Pretty simple.

Common code lives in a [Shared Project](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/application_fundamentals/shared_projects/), which is referenced by each application project. This project type requires Xamarin 3 (Xamarin Studio 5.x) or Visual Studio 2013 Update 2.
